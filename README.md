# Shiny-App-Poisson
Shiny app to compute optimal sample size for Poisson single sample trials using exact methods.
We consider power-based criteria and rely on exact test procedures. 
Traditionally, power-based criteria exploit the conditional frequentist power to determine the optimal sample size. 
In our work, we implement also the frequenstist predictive power, which is an hybrid Bayesian-frequentist power function, and two completely Bayesian power functions to account for external information available on the treatment.
These methods are based on a two-prior approach because we consider to distinguished power distributions.
